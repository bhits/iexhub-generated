 *             A quantity constructed as the quotient of a numerator
 *             quantity divided by a denominator quantity. Common
 *             factors in the numerator and denominator are not
 *             automatically cancelled out.   supports titers
 *             (e.g., "1:128") and other quantities produced by
 *             laboratories that truly represent ratios. Ratios are
 *             not simply "structured numerics", particularly blood
 *             pressure measurements (e.g. "120/60") are not ratios.
 *             In many cases REAL should be used instead
 *             of .
